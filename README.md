# CP/M-m68k for GCC

This is GCC CP/M M68k 1.2a Version, of the original Digital Research CP/M M68k 1.2a. There are slide changes from original, due to dialekt differences of the original CC Compiler and GCC. Also changes of the Assembler source were changed to match with Gnu Assembler. It runs in an simulated 68020 environment, also executables with the CP/M. Move to sr is changed to "Move to ccr" on fly.
